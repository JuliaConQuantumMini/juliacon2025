# Introduction to quantum theory (in an hour or less!)

In this session we'll go over some of the basics of quantum theory to set the stage for our introduction to classical simulation of quantum systems and quantum computation. In particular, we will cover:

- A brief review of classical probability to motivate the changes we need to understand quantum systems
- Some hands-on exercises to explore how we represent quantum objects on classical hardware
- Discuss why we might care about this from a computer science or high-performance computing point of view
